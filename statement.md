# Project Statement: BMI Calculator

## Problem Statement

Maintaining a healthy body weight is important for overall well-being. However, many people struggle to understand whether their weight is healthy relative to their height. There is a need for a simple, accessible tool that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and interprets its health category to help users monitor and understand their weight status.

## Scope of the Project

This project aims to provide a user-friendly Python command-line application that:
- Prompts users for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters)
- Calculates the BMI using standard formula
- Interprets the calculated BMI into health categories: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obesity
- Handles invalid or erroneous inputs gracefully
- Focuses on usability and basic input validation, not advanced medical diagnostics

## Target Users

- Individuals interested in monitoring their weight and general health
- Students learning Python and interested in health-related programming projects
- Anyone looking for a simple, offline BMI screening tool
- Educators seeking examples of Python input handling and conditional logic

## High-Level Features

- Robust input validation for weight and height
- BMI calculation using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2
- Categorization of BMI: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obesity
- Clear, user-friendly messaging for both results and errors
- Command-line interface with step-by-step guidance
- Modular Python code structured with functions for clarity and reusability
